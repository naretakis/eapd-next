# Development Standards for eAPD-Next

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Configuration

- Use strict mode with all strict flags enabled
- No implicit any types allowed
- All functions must have explicit return types for public APIs
- Use proper type definitions for all props and state

### Component Standards

- All React components must be functional components with TypeScript
- Use proper prop interfaces with JSDoc comments
- Include accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Follow Material-UI component patterns and best practices

### File Organization

- Each component should have its own directory with:
  - `ComponentName.tsx` - Main component file
  - `index.ts` - Export file
  - `ComponentName.test.tsx` - Test file
  - `README.md` - Component documentation (for complex components)

### Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `APDEditor`, `FormField`)
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- Variables and functions: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Types and interfaces: PascalCase with descriptive names

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting (configured in .prettierrc)
- Follow ESLint rules (configured in eslint.config.mjs)
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- Minimum 80% code coverage for all new code
- All components must have unit tests
- Critical user flows must have integration tests
- Accessibility tests required for all interactive components

### Test Structure

- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Jest for unit tests and mocking
- Test files should be co-located with components
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested

### Test Patterns

```typescript
// Good test structure
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render with default props', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle user interaction correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should be accessible to screen readers', () => {
    // Accessibility test
  });
});
```

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Include detailed description for complex changes

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `test` - Staging environment
- `dev` - Development environment
- Feature branches: `feature/task-description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/issue-description`

### Pull Request Requirements

- All tests must pass
- Code review required from at least one team member
- No merge conflicts
- Updated documentation if needed
- Accessibility review for UI changes

## Performance Standards

### Bundle Size

- Monitor bundle size with each build
- Use code splitting for large components
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize images and assets

### Runtime Performance

- Components should render in under 100ms
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Security Guidelines

### Data Handling

- All user input must be validated
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Sanitize data before storage
- No sensitive data in localStorage (use IndexedDB)

### Dependencies

- Regular security audits with npm audit
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review new dependencies before adding
- Use exact versions in package.json for critical dependencies

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG Compliance

- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Proper color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Screen reader compatibility required

### Implementation

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Implement focus management
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- README files for complex components
- Architecture decision records for major changes
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### User Documentation

- Clear setup instructions in README
- Component usage examples
- Troubleshooting guides
- Learning resources for new developers

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries

- Implement error boundaries for component trees
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error logging and reporting

### Validation

- Client-side validation for all forms
- Server-side validation for all data
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. Run `npm run dev` for development server
2. Run `npm run test:watch` for continuous testing
3. Run `npm run lint` before committing
4. Use `npm run type-check` for TypeScript validation

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Performance impact considered
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### Deployment Process

- All changes go through CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing on multiple environments
- Manual testing on staging before production
- Rollback plan for production deployments
