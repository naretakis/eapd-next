# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The eAPD-Next Web Application is a modern, browser-based solution designed to streamline the APD (Advance Planning Document) submission process for state Medicaid agencies. This application provides a guided experience for creating, managing, and exporting APDs entirely within the browser, with a dashboard-centric workflow for APD management.

The application addresses critical pain points identified through user research, including complicated budget calculations, the need for centralized creation and management processes, minimizing rework through validation, and providing clear guidance on APD expectations. The solution operates entirely offline with local browser storage, ensuring data privacy and security while providing a modern, accessible interface using Material-UI components.

This project also serves as a comprehensive learning platform for modern web development best practices, incorporating Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Material-UI while following industry-standard development workflows and documentation practices.
