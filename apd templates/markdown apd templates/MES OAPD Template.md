### 3.1 Proposed Budget


>[!info]+
> Include the proposed budget or revised funding requested in this OAPD.
>
> Ensure and attest that the costs of the system are determined in accordance with 45 C.F.R Part 75, subpart E. [42 CFR § 433.112(b)(7)]
>
> The proposed budget presents the total project cost and the overall request for FFP. This would include the total operational FFP costs (75%), and the total of any general administrative FFP (50%). It should then separate the requested federal match amount and the state amount. The state should submit a proposed two-year budget; however, providing a budget estimate for a longer period would be helpful to CMS.
>
> **Table D** and **Table E** provide examples of budget detail to lay out the proposed project budget.
> > [!Example Budget Text]+
> > The state’s total budget is estimated at $265,000, which includes $198,750 (75% Federal Share) and $66,250 (25% State Share). The state is requesting $265,000 in new OAPD funding and $0 in new MMIS APD funds for activities for October 2025 – October 2026.
> > 
> > **Increase example:** The state is asking for an increase in 75% FFP in the amount of $xxxxx to cover an increased cost in the operations of module X. The increase is due to an increase in resource cost. 
> > 
> > **Decrease example:** The state is requesting a decrease in the previously approved 75% FFP in the amount of $xxxx for the performance of activity A. This decrease is due to activity A being delayed and will now be performed in the upcoming fiscal year.

### Appendix D. Outcomes and Metrics

>[!info]+
> In accordance with 42 CFR § 433.112(b)(15), states must submit transaction data, reports, and performance metrics to support program evaluation, continuous improvement, and accountability. Each OAPD submission must include an attestation specifying the CMS designated repository of the submitted Operational Report Workbook (ORW). State must also attest that 12 months of metrics data (or data from the go-live date if the system has been live for less than 12 months) has been submitted using the **Operational Report Workbook**.
> 
> If data has not yet been submitted, the state must explain why and provide an estimated timeline for submission.
> 
> CMS-required outcomes must be reported for each applicable module in this OAPD when the state requests enhanced federal matching funds. This includes legacy systems, certified systems, systems of record, and those claiming enhanced rates for DDI or operations.
> 
> Complete Table I by listing all applicable CMS-required outcome reference numbers for each module included in this OAPD. For each outcome, indicate whether it applies or explain why it does not. In the final column, include any new or updated metrics that will be reported in the Operational Report Workbook but were not included in a previous APD.
> 
> The state could use an attachment instead of **Table I** and **Table J**.

#### Table J. State-Specific Outcomes and Metrics

>[!info]+
> List the business goals, associated state-specific outcome reference #, state-specific outcome(s), and any new or modified metrics for the project that will be reported in the Operational Report Workbook (ORW) and were not included in a previous APD.
> 
> For the state-specific outcome reference #, use the acronym “ST” (not the state abbreviation), followed by the appropriate module abbreviation, and a number: ST[ModuleAbbreviation][ConsecutiveNumber]
> 
> **Example:** If a state provides a state-specific outcome for its LTSS module, the first outcome reference # would be: STLTSS01
> 
> Module abbreviations are available in the appendices of the procedure manual in the MES Certification Repository.
> 
> For new or modified outcomes briefly explain why you are requesting a new or modified outcome.
> 
> For the New/Modified Metric column, briefly explain why you are requesting a new or modified metric.
> 
> The reference # used in **Table J** should match the identifier defined in the ORW and, if applicable, the SMC Intake Form to ensure consistency across documents.
