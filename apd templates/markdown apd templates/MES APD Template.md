## 7.  Proposed Activity Schedule for the Project

>[!info]+
> Provide a high-level activity schedule describing the nature and scope of system work and the methods used to execute the work (45 CFR § 95.610(a)(2)(ii), 45 CFR § 95.610(b)(7)). In general, the description should match the major milestones, deliverables, and key dates on the project schedule or work plan.
> 
> - Activity examples could include identifying risks and creating a preliminary mitigation strategy, documenting the As-Is and To-Be environments, and developing proposal evaluation criteria for procurement proposals. This could also include anticipated certification review dates, UAT completion dates, and go-live dates for projects in implementation.
> - If the system/module produces or receives data that will go to the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), indicate if the CMS Division of Business Essential Systems (DBES) Large System Enhancement (LSE) procedure will be completed.
> - The state may repeat activities as needed for multiple projects.
> 
> For E&E projects already underway, states should prioritize, in the following order, delivery performance tuning for Medicaid Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) determinations (including accuracy and efficiency, and optimization of real-time eligibility determinations); delivery of additional Medicaid MAGI functionality based upon any new federal or state requirements; dynamic notices to beneficiaries; and delivery of non-MAGI functionality.
> 
> If the activity is complete, annotate completion date in the “Estimated Finish Date” column of **Table C**.

## 8. Proposed Budget

>[!info]+
> States should include the proposed or revised budget funding requested in this APD (45 CFR § 95.610(a)(2)(iii), 45 CFR § 95.610(b)(8), and 45 CFR § 95.610(c)(1)(v)), as well as ensure and attest that the costs of the system are determined in accordance with 45 CFR Part 75, subpart E (42 CFR § 433.112(b)(7)).
> 
> This section should describe the funding needs for planning and/or implementation for which FFP is requested by FFY. List funding needs by categories, cost elements, and amounts, including state and/or contractor staff costs, facility/equipment, travel, outreach, training, etc. In-house staff costs and other costs by outside contractors should be distinguished from each other. Estimate the total budget with costs broken down by categories (state / federal and by applicable FFP rates).
> 
> The proposed budget presents the total project cost and the overall request for FFP. This would include the total development FFP (90%), the operational FFP costs (75%), and the total of any general administrative FFP (50%). It should then separate the requested federal match amount and the state amount. The state should submit a proposed two-year budget; however, providing a budget estimate for a longer period would be helpful to CMS.
> 
> In addition, this section should specify the period within which the FFP will be claimed. This will correspond to the Proposed Activity Schedule. Submit details to specify the dates within which APD activities were performed, are currently performed, and will be performed. Include the project costs associated with each of the activities by time period.
> 
> **Table D** and **Table E** provide examples of budget detail to lay out the proposed project budget.
> > [!Example Budget Text]-
> > The state’s total budget is estimated at $465,000, which includes $418,500 (90%) Federal Share and $46,500 (10%) State Share. The state is requesting $465,000 increase to previously approved APD funding and $0 in new MMIS APD funds for activities for October 2025 – October 2026. The state also requests a decrease of $0 (90% federal funds) in unspent funds for planning activities approved under the state’s MMIS PAPD due to project delays.
> > 
> > The state can also include a narrative on new amounts, increased/decreased amounts, or deleted amounts. This is helpful to CMS to better understand what caused a requested change in FFP.
> > 
> > **Increase example:** The state is asking for an increase in 90% FFP in the amount of $xxx,xxx to cover an increased cost in the implementation of functionality X. The increase is due to an increase in resource cost. 
> > 
> > **Decrease example:** The state is requesting a decrease in previously approved 90% FFP in the amount of $xxx,xxx for the performance of activity 1. This decrease is due to activity A being delayed and will now be performed in the upcoming fiscal year.

### 8.1 Medicaid Detail Budget Table (MDBT)

>[!info]+
> The MDBT must be submitted with this APD for all MMIS or E&E funding requests. It is optional to include a copy of the MDBT in this section. 
> 
> This section contains four separate tables corresponding to the sheets in the MDBT Excel file. The tables have been reformatted for better readability while preserving all required CMS compliance structure.
> 
> **Funding Categories:**
> - **DDI (Design, Development, and Implementation)**: System development activities
> - **M&O (Maintenance and Operations)**: Ongoing system operations
> - **E&E (Eligibility and Enrollment)**: Activities related to eligibility determination and enrollment

## 10.  Cost Allocation Plan for Implementation Activities

>[!info]+
> This section is to be completed if there are other programs benefiting from the project/system)
> 
> The cost allocation must comply with the requirements outlined in 45 CFR § 95.507. It is imperative for each federal benefitting program to thoroughly review the State agency’s cost allocation plan during both the planning and implementation phases of a project. As specified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87, a cost allocation plan must be included that identifies all participants and their associated cost allocation to depict non-Medicaid activities and non-Medicaid Full-Time Equivalents participating in this project, if any.
> 
> **PAPD** – States should provide an estimated total project cost and a prospective state and federal cost allocation/distribution, including planning and implementation (45 CFR § 95.610(a)(2)(iv)).
> 
> **IAPD, APDU, or As-Needed** – States should provide an estimate of the prospective cost allocation/distribution to the various state and federal funding sources and the proposed procedures for distributing costs (45 CFR § 95.610(b)(10)). If an estimate cannot be provided, provide a report of any approved or anticipated changes to the allocation basis in the APD’s approved cost allocation methodology (45 CFR § 95.610(c)(vii)).
> - For projects in DDI, CMS will work with states to determine the most appropriate cost allocation methodology, as needed. MES cost allocation formulas should be based on the direct benefit to the Medicaid program based on utilization. Cost allocation must account for other available federal funding sources, the division of resources and activities across relevant payers, and the relative benefit to the State Medicaid program, among other factors.
> - Cost allocation should involve all parties' timely financial participation to ensure that Medicaid funds are neither the sole contributor at the onset nor the primary funding source for work that benefits multiple programs. Other payers who stand to benefit must contribute their share from the beginning. The absence of other payers is not sufficient cause for Medicaid to be the primary payer (2 CFR § 200.405(d)).

### Appendix D. Outcomes and Metrics

>[!info]+
> Using **Table L** list all the CMS-required outcome reference numbers for the systems and/or module(s) within this APD. Indicate whether each is applicable, and if not, explain why. The last column should list any new or modified metrics that will be reported in the Operational Report Workbook (ORW) but were not included in a previous APD. Use the CMS-required outcomes on the MES Certification Repository (https://cmsgov.github.io/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Certification/) for the applicable module(s) to populate the table.
> 
> The state could use an attachment instead of **Table L** and **Table M** if the attachment includes all the fields from both tables.

#### Table O. State-Specific Outcomes and Metrics

>[!info]+
> List the business goals, associated state-specific outcome reference #, state-specific outcome(s), and any new or modified metrics for the project that will be reported in the Operational Report Workbook (ORW) and were not included in a previous APD.
> 
> For the state-specific outcome reference #, use the acronym “ST” (not the state abbreviation), followed by the appropriate module abbreviation, and a number: ST[ModuleAbbreviation][ConsecutiveNumber]
> 
> **Example:** If a state provides a state-specific outcome for its LTSS module, the first outcome reference # would be: STLTSS01
> 
> Module abbreviations are available in the appendices of the procedure manual in the MES Certification Repository.
> 
> For new or modified outcomes briefly explain why you are requesting a new or modified outcome.
> 
> The reference # used in **Table M** should match the identifier defined in the ORW and, if applicable, the SMC Intake Form to ensure consistency across documents.

| Business Goal | State-Specific Outcome Reference # | State-Specific Outcome | New / Modified Metric |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |

### Appendix E. Certification

>[!info]+
> **This section should contain information about certification of the system and/or module, if needed.**
> 
> Complete **Table N** by answering each question with “Yes” or “No,” and provide explanations where necessary.
> 
> The state should include a separate table for each project included in this APD and identify the project name in the table caption.
> 
> If any of the responses below are “No,” this module or system may not need certification.
> 
> In the space below, summarize the state's position on the need for certification and include a high-level timeline of key activities and milestones for the proposed system/module related certification.
> 
> Please note that if it is determined that certification is not required, the state may still qualify to receive enhanced funding and be required to provide data through operational reporting as per 42 CFR § 433.112(b)(15).
