# [State] Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)


>[!info]+
> ## AoA Backround
> An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is a structured, comprehensive process used in information technology (IT) project management to evaluate multiple potential solutions before selecting the most effective approach. It enables stakeholders to make informed, objective decisions by comparing each alternative’s strengths, weaknesses, risks, costs, and benefits. The AoA may also reveal opportunities to leverage existing solutions or adopt new technologies, ensuring that states consider a range of options to identify the most efficient, economical, and effective path forward.
> 
> As described under 45 CFR 95.610, states must complete an AoA—including reuse considerations—during the planning phase or prior to initiating new system implementations, system replacement or takeover, and/or hardware acquisitions.
> 
> States are expected to “promote sharing, leverage, and reuse of Medicaid technologies and systems within and among states.” Guidance on reuse is detailed in State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL) #18-005, issued by CMS on April 18, 2018. Leverage and reuse are key considerations as state Medicaid Agencies conduct their AoA and meet Conditions for Enhanced Funding (CEF). 
> ## Using This Document
> This AoA template is designed to help states efficiently document their analysis and rationale for selecting a solution for an MES project. States are encouraged to reuse relevant content from Advance Planning Documents (APDs) or other existing materials when completing the template.
> 
> All sections of the AoA template should be completed. If a section is left incomplete, the state must provide a justification. The examples provided are illustrative and can be modified to reflect the specifics of the state's project. Submissions missing required sections without explanation will be considered incomplete by CMS. If there is a reason any of the checklist items cannot be included, please note this rather than omitting the item.
> 
> CMS also recommends that states update the AoA as needed. Keeping the analysis current ensures that the most accurate and relevant information informs decisions.
> 
> Before delivery, delete all instructions and guidance tables in the template. If the state elects to adopt any of the sample text, please update and reformat the text before submitting the AoA.

## Table of Contents
[PLACEHOLDER FOR MARKDOWN TOC]

## Executive Summary

> [!INFO]-
> An AoA executive summary should encapsulate the key findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the analysis. The executive summary section should be no longer than one (1) page.
> 
> Complete sections 1 through 6 of the AoA first. Once the AoA is complete, return to this Executive Summary section and summarize key findings, conclusions, and recommendations in a few paragraphs.
> 
> The target audience of this section is the executive leadership team of the State Medicaid Agency (SMA), State information technology (IT), and CMS.

## 1. AoA Approach

> [!INFO]-
> A complete AoA begins with a well-crafted approach that delineates responsibilities and guides the analysis process. It is driven by the needs of the project stakeholders and decision-makers, previous analyses, and constraints.
> 
> In this section, states should detail their approach to conducting the AoA. This is sometimes called an AoA Study Plan.
> 
> The AoA approach section should not exceed two (2) pages.
> 
> Checklist
> - [ ] Explain the scope of the AoA and how it was defined, who participated in the AoA exercise, and how they were identified or selected.
> - [ ] Explain how and where participants collaborated, the state’s approach to documentation, key AoA milestones, and the timeframes associated with the overall exercise.
> - [ ] Provide the state’s approach to identifying, analyzing, and selecting alternatives, along with the methods to remove bias.
> - [ ] Provide details on any other key methodology for developing the AoA.
> - [ ] If the state has AoA process documents, a study/project plan, or an internal “scope of work,” include these items here or as an appendix.

## 2. Market Research and Reuse

> [!INFO]-
> Use this section to describe the state’s market research and any reuse under consideration for this project. Market research is the systematic gathering and analysis of information about vendors, state-supported products/solutions, market trends, pricing, and product availability to support informed decision-making.
> 
> In the context of an MES project, the state’s market research should include a search of current solutions that are (1) available on the market or used in other agencies, (2) in the state’s enterprise, or (3) in other state, federal, and local government organizations. The process may entail surveys, phone calls, an official request for information (RFI), or professional contacts, and must be documented along with the search results.
> 
> This research is essential because it may also reveal opportunities for reuse that enable CMS and states to leverage existing IT assets effectively.
> 
> In evaluating options for building a state MES, the state should select solutions that maximize reuse opportunities.
>

### 2.1 Market Research

> [!INFO]-
> **Checklist for Market Research:**
> - [ ] Detail the process for conducting market research and identifying any key points of contact.
> - [ ] Develop critical takeaways on product availability, cost estimates, lessons learned, alignment, and timelines.

[Insert written content here]

### 2.2 Reuse

> [!INFO]-
> **Checklist for Reuse:**
> - [ ] As described in State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL) #18-005, highlight any “reusable components” discovered during the market research phase, including but not limited to the sharing of artifacts, documents, services or systems, code segments, and business rules, such as APDs, requests for proposals (RFP), CMS-approved milestone review documentation, artifacts developed to support operations and management, and other development artifacts.
> - [ ] Based on the state’s Enterprise MES Reuse Plan, summarize the reuse strategy in support of “systemic reuse” for the MES project specific to this AoA. **If the state does not have a formal Enterprise MES Reuse Plan, it can use Appendix A's template components to create one.**
> - [ ] The Reuse plan should describe how reuse opportunities are identified and the process for capitalizing on those opportunities. This description should include, but is not limited to, the tools and infrastructure needed to support reuse, staff training to better identify and select reuse, and review and improvement approaches that establish mechanisms to improve the reuse process over time.
> - [ ] Explain how the state plans to make available to other states (for leverage and reuse) their project artifacts, documents, systems components, contract details, code, or other related material. This could include the state’s intent to share information at conferences or via the MES Certification Repository.
> - [ ] Highlight any reuse alternatives that will be evaluated and scored as part of the AoA in Section **Error! Reference source not found.**, 5, and 6. Provide details on the specific weight given to the reuse evaluation criteria, if applicable. If no reuse options are presented as viable alternatives, the state should explain why these alternatives were not feasible.
> - [ ] Provide a brief narrative explaining the state’s ability and preparedness to collaborate with other states, recognizing that this may present unique challenges compared to the more familiar experience of working with vendors.

## 3. Evaluation Criteria

> [!INFO]-
> Alternatives must be compared in a thorough and non-biased fashion. This section should include:
> 1. A brief explanation of the process for choosing the evaluation criteria.
> 2. A table identifying and defining the evaluation criteria (including considerations and benchmarks for evaluation and scoring).
> 3. A scoring guide to assess the alternatives.
> 
> Criteria should align with the project goals, requirements, and constraints. Evaluation criteria **must include, but are not limited to, reuse functionality, cost, benefits, and risks**. Other standard criteria are scalability, ease of implementation, vendor reputation, user experience, innovation potential (use of modern tools/technology stacks), organizational impact, schedule, maintainability, security, and accessibility. Consider having stakeholders vote on the most critical selection criteria based on business and technical needs and weigh the criteria accordingly. If the criteria are not weighted, remove that column from Table E.
> 
> Assigning weights reflects the criterion's importance to the business and Medicaid program and is used in calculating the score. The weights should add up to 100 percent or 1.0.
> 
> Checklist
> - [ ] Summarize evaluation criteria selection methodology, including the weighting, if applicable.
> - [ ] Describe the state-specific analysis criteria (optional to use Table E).
> - [ ] The description of each criterion in Table E should assist the stakeholders in scoring.
> - [ ] Identify the scoring guide in Table  based on the state’s preferred approach (optional to use Table ).
> - [ ] Ensure that the scoring approach applies consistently across all criteria in Table E.

## 5. Evaluation Matrix

> [!INFO]-
> In this section, the state provides an evaluation matrix or rubric for scoring each alternative against the evaluation criteria from Section 3. Including a rubric in the AoA process enhances transparency and objectivity by providing a structured framework for evaluating alternatives. A rubric also ensures that all stakeholders use established criteria and weights in the decision-making process to increase reliability and rigor in the evaluation. The rubric should be well-defined, clearly communicated, and consistently applied across all alternatives.
> 
> Checklist
> - [ ] For each alternative, assess and score its performance against each criterion using the scoring system provided in the Scoring Guide in Section 3.
> - [ ] Optionally, weights can be applied to criteria if certain factors are deemed more critical than others. Multiply the score by the assigned weight for each criterion.
> - [ ] Obtain a total score by summing up the weighted scores for each alternative.
> - [ ] The alternative with the highest total score may be considered the most favorable option, which should be annotated in the solution rank section of the table.
> - [ ] Remember to customize the rubric based on your project's specific needs, objectives, and context. Adjust the criteria, weights, and scoring system to align with the analysis's priorities and goals.

## Appendix
### Appendix A. Enterprise MES Reuse Plan

#### **Introduction**

A State **Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) Reuse Plan** offers a formalized framework for systematically identifying, capturing, storing, and reusing existing system components, designs, requirements, and institutional knowledge across multiple MES initiatives. By capitalizing on previously developed assets rather than initiating efforts from the ground up, states can achieve greater operational efficiency, reduce implementation costs, and enhance overall system quality.

This plan maximizes the value of Medicaid technology investments by advancing standardization, promoting interoperability, supporting long-term sustainability, and enabling cost-effective solutions across the enterprise. It encourages collaboration among business, technology, and policy stakeholders while streamlining development processes to meet state and federal compliance mandates. Furthermore, a well-executed reuse strategy mitigates redundant efforts, shortens project delivery timelines, and strengthens the adaptability and responsiveness of Medicaid IT modernization activities.

Appendix Table A delineates key components of a state MES Reuse Plan and provides a comprehensive framework for implementation and annual refinement.
