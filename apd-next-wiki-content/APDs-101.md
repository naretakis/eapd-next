## What is an APD?
An Advance Planning Document (APD) refers to a document providing a recorded plan of action to request funding approval for a project which will require the use of technology services or equipment, including the use of shared or purchased services in lieu of state government acquired standalone resources. For additional information see:
- [45 CFR 95.610](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-95/subpart-F/subject-group-ECFR8ea7e78ba47a262/section-95.610) - for regulatory details regarding creating and submitting of advance planning documents.
- [45 CFR 95.611](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-95/subpart-F/subject-group-ECFR8ea7e78ba47a262/section-95.611) - for regulatory details regarding prior approval conditions for APDs
- [42 CFR 433 Subpart C](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-C/part-433/subpart-C) - for regulatory details regarding APD requirements for Medicaid Enterprise Systems (Mechanized Claims Processing and Information Retrieval Systems)

More simply, APDs provide a standardized way for states to request Federal funding to support  technology projects which will advance, improve, or support a state's Medicaid program. 

In order to qualify for any Federal Financial Participation (FFP), State's must submit APDs to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for approval **prior** to obligating any Federal funding to a project. Failure to comply with this requirement, known as prior approval, may result in states not receiving Federal funding for a portion or the entirety of a project.
### Different types of APDs
There are three broad types of APDs, reflecting where a project may be in development: planning, implementation, or operations. 

They are aptly named as such:
* Planning APD (PAPD)
* Implementation APD (IAPD)
* Operational APD (OAPD)

Updates to the existing APDs can also be submitted and are named accordingly:
* Planning APD Update (PAPD-U)
* Implementation APD Update (IAPD-U)
* Operational APD Update (OAPD-U)

### APD Contents
APDs contain details to explain the Who, What, When, Why, How, and How Much for projects.

## APD Creation, Submission, Review, Response and Decision Cycle

APDs are authored by states/territories and submitted to CMS for review. The review of the APDs are conducted with a multi-disciplinary team and coordinated by the Medicaid Enterprise Systems State Officer. Any questions/clarifications around the APD are submitted to the state for response and, if needed, updates to the submission. Final decisions on APDs are communicated through a formal letter to the State.
