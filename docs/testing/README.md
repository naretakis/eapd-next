# Testing Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive testing strategies, frameworks, and procedures for eAPD-Next.

## ðŸ“‹ Contents

- **[Testing Framework](Testing-Framework.md)** - Overview of testing types and tools
- **[Testing Philosophies and Strategies](Testing-Philosophies-and-Strategies.md)** - Shift-left approach and methodologies
- **[Testing Checklist](TESTING-CHECKLIST.md)** - Comprehensive testing procedures and verification steps

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Philosophy

### Shift Left Testing

- Start testing early in the development cycle
- Catch problems before they become bigger issues
- Reduce bottlenecks and improve delivery speed
- Test engineers collaborate with product/design from the start

### Quality Standards

- **Target Coverage**: 90% code coverage (realistic goal)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance (508 compliant)
- **Performance**: Components render in <100ms
- **Integration**: All features tested in CI/CD pipeline

## ðŸ§ª Testing Types

### Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Test individual component functionality
- **Goal**: 100% code coverage for isolated components
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Focus**: Component behavior, props, state management

### Integration Testing

- **Purpose**: "Happy path" testing of feature workflows
- **Goal**: Ensure components work together correctly
- **Tools**: React Testing Library, Jest
- **Focus**: User workflows, data flow, component interaction

### Visual Regression Testing

- **Purpose**: Catch unintended visual changes
- **Goal**: Document and review all visual modifications
- **Tools**: TBD (to be determined)
- **Focus**: UI consistency, responsive design, theme compliance

### Accessibility Testing

- **Purpose**: Ensure 508 compliance and WCAG AA standards
- **Goal**: Full accessibility for all users
- **Tools**: axe-core, manual testing
- **Focus**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation, color contrast

### End-to-End Testing

- **Purpose**: Complete user journey validation
- **Goal**: Critical paths work from start to finish
- **Tools**: TBD (to be determined)
- **Focus**: APD creation, editing, export workflows

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist Summary

The [Testing Checklist](TESTING-CHECKLIST.md) provides step-by-step procedures for:

- **Pre-deployment Testing**: Local verification before merging
- **Component Testing**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Testing**: Feature workflow verification
- **Accessibility Testing**: Compliance validation
- **Performance Testing**: Speed and responsiveness checks
- **Browser Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Integration

All testing types are integrated into the continuous integration pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Pull Request Checks**: Unit tests, integration tests, accessibility tests
3. **Deployment Pipeline**: Full test suite, visual regression, performance tests
4. **Post-deployment**: Smoke tests, monitoring, user acceptance

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Gates

### Before Merging to Main

- [ ] All unit tests pass (minimum 80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Manual testing completed

### Before Release

- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Visual regression review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed

## ðŸ“Š Metrics and Measurement

### Code Coverage

- **Current Target**: 80% minimum, 90% goal
- **Tools**: Jest coverage reports, Codecov integration
- **Monitoring**: Coverage trends, regression detection

### Performance Metrics

- **Render Time**: <100ms for components
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize
- **Accessibility Score**: 100% compliance target

### Quality Indicators

- **Test Reliability**: Consistent pass/fail results
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Time spent fixing flaky tests
- **Bug Detection**: Tests catching issues before production

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### For New Developers

1. Read [Testing Philosophies](Testing-Philosophies-and-Strategies.md)
2. Review [Testing Framework](Testing-Framework.md)
3. Follow [Testing Checklist](TESTING-CHECKLIST.md) procedures

### For Feature Development

1. Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
2. Include accessibility tests for UI components
3. Add integration tests for user workflows
4. Update testing documentation as needed
