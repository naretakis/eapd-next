## Shifting Testing to the Left

- To shift testing to the left means to break the traditional way of testing, in which testing is normally done at the end. When testing is moved to the left it starts the process of testing earlier to streamline the development cycle as a whole.

### Why shift testing to the left? What is the goal?

- When testing is done at the very end it can become a bottleneck in the process, ultimately delaying product delivery. Shifting testing to the left is an aim to reduce that bottleneck and help catch potential problems earlier before they can become bigger down the road.
- How do we do that? Test engineers will meet with product/design to get the full scope of each feature. It is the tester's responsibility to ask questions about intent, possible risks, possible alternatives, intended functionality, etc...
- This whole process is to help smooth out the transitions from product -> design and from design -> product.

## Testing Tools we use:

- Unit testing: TBD
- End-to-end automation testing: TBD
- Visual: TBD

## Roles and Responsibilities for Testing

- Develop scripts to run automated tests
- Develop test plans and follow guidelines set by test plan.

## How do we measure testing? Codecov? Outputs? Metrics?

- One way we measure testing is through code coverage. Which is a percentage of what lines of code are being touched by our tests. Ideally every project would like to have 100% code coverage. While that may seem reasonable, as projects expand it is almost impossible to keep track of every single line of code. A more realistic target would be 90%, which is what we are aiming for.
