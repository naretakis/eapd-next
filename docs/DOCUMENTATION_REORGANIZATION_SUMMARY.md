# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation reorganization completed to improve navigation, maintainability, and discoverability of project documentation.

## 🎯 Goals Achieved

### **Purpose-Based Organization**

- Moved from artificial "wiki vs docs" distinction to logical grouping by purpose and audience
- Created clear navigation paths for different user types (developers, designers, testers, stakeholders)
- Established scalable structure that grows well with project complexity

### **Improved Discoverability**

- Added comprehensive README files in each subdirectory as navigation hubs
- Enhanced cross-referencing between related documentation
- Created clear entry points for different use cases

### **Better Maintainability**

- Grouped related content together for easier updates
- Established consistent patterns across all documentation
- Reduced duplication and improved content organization

## 🔄 Migration Summary

### **Files Moved**

#### From `docs/apd-next-wiki-content/` to Purpose-Based Directories:

- `About-eAPD-Next.md` → `docs/domain/`
- `APDs-101.md` → `docs/domain/`
- `Glossary-of-Acronyms.md` → `docs/domain/`
- `UX-Principles.md` → `docs/design/`
- `Content-guide.md` → `docs/design/`
- `Design-iterations-archive.md` → `docs/design/`
- `Testing-Framework.md` → `docs/testing/`
- `Testing-Philosophies-and-Strategies.md` → `docs/testing/`

#### Other Moves:

- `docs/development/TESTING-CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/testing/`
- `docs/apd templates/` → `docs/domain/apd templates/`
- `docs/apd-regulatory-context/` → `docs/domain/apd-regulatory-context/`

### **References Updated**

#### Main Project Files:

- `README.md` - Updated testing checklist path and added domain/design/testing sections
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added comprehensive documentation reorganization entry
- `.gitignore` - Updated testing checklist path

#### Steering Documents:

- `.kiro/steering/development-standards.md` - Enhanced documentation organization requirements
- `.kiro/steering/git-workflow.md` - Added documentation structure maintenance requirements
- `.kiro/steering/apd-domain-knowledge.md` - Updated file references to new paths

#### Internal Documentation:

- Cross-references updated throughout documentation
- Navigation paths enhanced in all hub files

## 🎯 Benefits Realized

### **For New Developers**

- Clear entry point at `docs/README.md`
- Logical progression from domain knowledge to implementation
- Easy discovery of relevant documentation

### **For Feature Development**

- Domain knowledge grouped for APD context
- Design principles easily accessible

## 📋 Navigation Patterns

### **Hub-and-Spoke Model**

Each directory has a comprehensive README that serves as:

- Navigation hub for that category
- Quick reference for key information
- Links to related documentation
- Target audience guidance

### **Cross-Referencing**

- Related documents link to each other
- Clear paths between different documentation types
- Multiple ways to find the same information
- Context-aware navigation suggestions

### **Audience-Focused Paths**

- **New Team Members**: domain/ → LEARNING_PATH.md → ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
- **Developers**: tasks/ → milkdown/ → development/
- **Designers**: design/ → domain/ (for user context)
- **Testers**: testing/ → development/ → TROUBLESHOOTING.md
