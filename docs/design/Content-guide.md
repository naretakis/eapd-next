## Writing Principles

The primary users of this product are subject matter experts with acute understanding of the APD submission process, content (and specifically, help text) in this application is designed to direct these users.

There are sections within the application that are extracted directly from the APD template from CMS.

## Voice & Tone

**Help the user understand**
Our users are analysts familiar with APDs, so we use direct language that helps the user understand what's expected throughout each section.

**Detail whenever possible**
Use examples where appropriate. Don't be afraid to avoid brevity when necessary to explain what's required.

**Avoid familiarity, be direct**
In translating a templated print experience into an application, it is not necessary to make language overtly personal, as our users do not expect this. Instead, opt for direct language that assumes a level of subject matter expertise with APDs.

**Write instructional help text**
Ensure the instructions & help text guide advises the user on what we need in each section.

## Style guidelines

In the status quo, APD language can be confusing and difficult to decipher. The goal then, is to develop content that is clear, direct, and errs on the side of explaining what to do in each section rather than assuming the end user already knows. While the users understand APDs and the underlying subject matter, they may not understand how to complete the APD using this interface.

Always remember that this app is very information-dense. Nobody is going to get full information from a quick read. **For edge cases, opt for a style that aids in scanning rather than one that provides all possible detail.** People will write, discuss, and calculate for that.

### Acronyms and abbreviations

- Spell out abbreviations on the first mention. See our [[Glossary-of-Acronyms]]
- APD, CMS, MMIS, and E&E are exceptions to that. They never need to be spelled out within the form itself. Consider spelling them out on other pages, using your judgment about whether there is sufficient context otherwise.
- If an abbreviation is used only once or twice on a page, or if what is abbreviated is very short, avoid using it.

### Capitalization

- Use title case for headers. This is especially imperative for `section titles` and `subsection titles`, which are headings at the `h1` and `h2` levels and also serve as the primary navigation of the app, but it should be observed universally unless further research says otherwise. Title case is easier to _scan_.
- Use sentence case for button labels and individual field labels. These govern refined information and interactions and specificity is important. Sentence case is easier to _read_.
- Unless starting a sentence or heading, do not capitalize “the” before a proper noun (for example: `the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services`).
- Use title case for legal citations (for example: `Access to Records, Reporting and Agency Attestations` and `42 CFR Part 495.350`).
- Outside of headers, Do not capitalize people’s official titles unless they precede a specific name (for example: `Medicaid director`).

### Numbers

- Use numerals instead of spelling out numbers. Avoid putting a number at the beginning of a sentence or headline.
- The numbers in this app are large; avoid extra digits. Where possible, round dollar amounts to the nearest whole dollar. For summary information, `k` and `M` are useful abbreviations that protect visual simplicity.
- Use the `%` sign instead of spelling out _percent_.
- Represent shares of discreet things, such as FTEs, as decimals (for example, 1.5 FTEs). Represent shares of wholes as percentages (for example, 75%). Do not use fractions.

### Punctuation and text styling

- Use the oxford comma.
- Add a single space after each period.
- Avoid using ampersands.
- When referring to buttons or sections, use _emphasis_ rather than “quotation marks”. Use quotation marks only when quoting something.
- Use the correct style of quotation marks and apostrophes (`‘’` and `“”` rather than`''` and `""`.
