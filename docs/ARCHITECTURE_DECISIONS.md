- **SEO and Accessibility**: Server-side rendering capabilities (though we're using static export)
- **Ecosystem**: Large community, extensive documentation, and Material-UI compatibility
- **Learning Value**: Modern React patterns and industry-standard tooling

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Create React App (CRA)**
   - Pros: Simple setup, well-established
   - Cons: Limited optimization, ejection required for customization, maintenance concerns
2. **Vite + React**
   - Pros: Fast development server, modern tooling
   - Cons: Less opinionated, requires more configuration, smaller ecosystem
3. **Remix**
   - Pros: Excellent data loading patterns, progressive enhancement
   - Cons: Newer framework, smaller community, learning curve

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Modern development experience, excellent performance, strong TypeScript support

## ADR-003: Data Storage Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

We need a client-side storage solution that can handle complex APD data structures, provide offline functionality, and ensure data privacy without server-side storage.

### Decision

We will use **IndexedDB** as our primary data storage mechanism.

### Rationale

- **Capacity**: Much larger storage limits compared to localStorage (typically 50MB+)
- **Structure**: Supports complex data structures and relationships
- **Performance**: Asynchronous operations don't block the UI
- **Offline Support**: Works completely offline without server dependencies
- **Privacy**: Data stays on user's device, meeting privacy requirements
- **Transactions**: ACID transactions for data integrity

### Alternatives Considered

1. **localStorage**
   - Pros: Simple API, synchronous operations
   - Cons: 5-10MB limit, synchronous blocking, string-only storage
2. **WebSQL**
   - Pros: SQL interface, good performance
   - Cons: Deprecated, limited browser support
3. **Server-side Database**
   - Pros: Centralized data, backup capabilities
   - Cons: Privacy concerns, requires authentication, network dependency

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Large storage capacity, offline functionality, data privacy
- **Negative**: More complex API, browser compatibility considerations
- **Neutral**: Requires backup/export functionality for data portability
